Let's update the README to reflect the accurate implementation details, mentioning the use of `react-native-view-shot` instead of `expo-image-manipulator` for the overlay functionality.

Here is the revised README:

# Simple Camera App

This React Native project implements a simple camera application that allows users to capture an image of food, overlay the app's logo, add a hardcoded macro description, and save the modified image to the device's storage.

## Requirements

1. **Camera Functionality:**
    - Implement the camera functionality to capture an image.

2. **Add Logo and Macro Description:**
    - Overlay a logo of the app on the captured image.
    - Add a hardcoded macro description of the food (e.g., "Protein: 10g, Carbs: 20g, Fat: 5g").
    - Ensure the position of the logo and macro description on the image is visually appropriate.

3. **Save Image to Device Storage:**
    - Save the modified image (with the logo and macro description) to the device storage.

4. **UI/UX:**
    - Provide a simple and clean UI for capturing the image and displaying the result.
    - Include basic navigation if needed.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the Simple Camera App on your local machine or device:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-camera-app.git
cd simple-camera-app
```

2. Install dependencies using Yarn:

```

3. Start the Expo development server:
```bash
yarn start
```

## Implementation Details

### Overlay and Storage Functionality

- **Overlay Implementation:**
    - Uses `react-native-view-shot` to capture the view containing the appâ€™s logo and the hardcoded macro description overlaid on the captured image. Positioning is adjusted based on the image dimensions for visual clarity.

- **Storage Functionality:**
    - Utilizes `expo-file-system` to save the processed image to the device's local storage. Handles any errors that may occur during the saving process to ensure data integrity.
    - Uses `expo-media-library` to save the image to the user's photo album.
